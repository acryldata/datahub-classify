I've spared no expense and typically replaced near by components during a repair. Extreme attention to detail and care has always been given.

Nationwide delivery available.The Liteace GXL Exurb was marketed as a commuter vehicle for those in the less populated areas on Japan. With plenty of capability to handle the more rural roads and enough comfort for commuting and city driving it made quite a nice little package. With only 40,000 miles on the clock, this Liteace is just beginning to stretch its legs. This particular example presents well and it is obvious that it was garaged for most of its life. The paint shines nicely, the interior is in excellent original condition, and it is free of rust issues. With its true 4wd system and small displacement turbo diesel this van is well suited for taking you on endless adventures, whether you venture far or near. The Liteace/Townace platform is a favorite for even the toughest of old forest roads thanks to its short wheel base, narrow track width, and respectable ground clearance. It was imported in April 2021 and is offered for your consideration.Specs:-40,471 miles-3C-T 2.2 liter turbo diesel engine-Automatic transmission with overdrive-4wd with transfer case and high/low rangeFeatures:-Two-tone silver and gray paint with factory stripe package-Aisin manual locking hubs-Yokohama Ice Guard iG50 Plus tires in 205/70R14 with excellent tread remaining and 2019 date codes-Full sized spare tire-Dual power sunroofs/moonroofs with retractable shade covers-Dual layer side and rear curtains-Cab divider curtains-Automatic dual zone climate control system with AC-Rear heat and AC with separate control panel-Power windows, door locks, and mirrors-Pop out side windows-Rear window defrost-Rear window wiper and sprayer-Accessory dash cup holders-Seating for 8-Front bucket seats-Rear bench seats configurable in reverse, sideways, folded flat as a bed, and every option in between-Rear bench seat folds to the side for increased storage capacity-NEW Atoto AM/FM/Bluetooth/Wifi touchscreen double din Android-based stereo with navigation capabilities and CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity-Toyota rain guards/wind deflectors on front windows-Front and rear mud flaps-Rear back-up mirror-Original owner's manual-PDF copy of factory service manual for chassisRecent Maintenance:-Oil change with new OEM filter-New OEM fuel filter-New OEM air filter-New Rain-X windshield wipersKnown Defects:-AC blows cool, but isn't spitting ice cubes and perhaps could benefit from a service-Minor scrapes to passenger side mirror, rear bumper, and left rear side panel-The wheels would look better with a fresh coat of paintSold  with all original import documents needed for registration in your  state (CA excluded) - CBP 7501 (stamped by US Customs official), EPA   3520-1, DOT HS-7, Export Certificate (title), English translation of  export certificate, Commercial Invoice, Bill of Lading, Notice of    Arrival, and a Bill of Sale. 100% federally legal. *Please note,  this vehicle is subject to CA sales tax (however, this typically can be applied as an offset against  sales tax in your state).

To whom it may concern.  This vehicle was specially built for Richard E Haas to campaign in major NHRA drag racing events in 1967. It was important to Oldsmobile， that they had good representation at all regional and national events in an effort to win the NHRA manufacturer's championship.  Oldsmobile won several back-to-back stock car manufacturer's championships during this era.  Dale Smith“Oldsmobile Special Vehicle Operations Manager"" was very successful in working with the sanctioning bodies and all types of racers. Dale was able to get a large return for a very small investment(Oldsmobile had no racing budget at this time); Dale was limited to giving a few parts and information to those who chose to run Oldsmobile vehicles.  I worked at the GM Proving Grounds for Oldsmobile， and in1965 ran a 442 automatic. In 1966 I ran a four-speed tri-power and got a little engine help from Mr. Smith. As a GM employee，, I could order and buy a new vehicle equipped， as I wanted at a GM discount. l also had the option of purchasing a vehicle with 3000 miles on it for a larger discount. In 1967 I told Mr.Smith that I would like to run all of the regional and National NHRA events and wanted to know if he could help in any way?  We ordered the above vehicle equipped, as we wanted. On the build date, Mr. Smith made sure the folks that installed the insulation did not work too hard, in fact, Dale most likely took them to the pop machine as the car passed by.  The vehicle was sent to the Proving Ground to get its 3000 miles. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith was at Olds Engineering Assembly Dept having an NHRA legal blueprinted engine built. He did not stop there, he got with the transmission group and they came up with a super combination and special torque converters with a manual switch to be mounted on the floorboard to operate the pitch or the ratio of the converter at will. Later in the year the transmission group built and let us run a six-speed in this car.  At the end of the 3000 miles, the vehicle was sent to Olds engineering where the engine, transmission, and suspension parts were installed.  I picked up the vehicle from product delivery like any other 3000-mile car and ran all of the NHRA events, including the Nationals at Indy.  At the end of 1967, I sold the above vehicle. Had two more owners and I purchased the vehicle. Have all owner info!  I was fortunate to be able to work at the GM proving grounds for Oldsmobile during this time frame. I did most of the performance testing for Oldsmobile including, the cold air induction that is a production, feature on the above car. It was nice to be apart of the test and development. Competing was even better.  For anyone interested in Oldsmobile history, a book by Dale Smith is available and published by Backfire press PO Box 455 Harrison MI. 49625  (Racing to the past: Oldsmobile and its demise/D.

I'm the third owner and have logged 125,000 of the 168,000 miles; mostly highway miles but also putting the vehicle through the paces off-road. This is an amazingly capable off-road rig and by far the best (and most fun) vehicle I've ever owned. I've taken great care of her and done all scheduled and necessary maintenance, mostly at the local Toyota dealership.   This is the rare 2010 sandstone color (including the roof) Trail Teams Edition FJ Cruiser which in addition to Toyota's standard Off Road Package includes: Bilstein shocks, rear differential lock, A-TRAC, front and rear skid plates, TRD beadlock-style alloy wheels, BFG tires, rock rails, hood blackout color to reduce glare, wheel locks, subwoofer and built-in inverter providing 12V, 100W and 115V 400W outlets.   I've added upgrades and modifications to create a true overland adventure vehicle, including: ARB 47L fridge/freezer mounted on slider drawer, dash-mounted solar controller and battery isolater for portable or permanent solar panel charging (pv panels not included; I was using a fold-up/portable solar array), Rhino Rack Pioneer Platform roof rack, James Baroud Space Evo rooftop tent, Rhino Rack Foxwing wrap-around awning and simple platform build for efficient gear storage in back.   The one and only repair needed is that the volume dial on the stereo doesn't work, but you can still control volume via the steering wheel controls.  Asking $28,000 or best offer and happy to answer any questions",,az,35.387623,-111.384791,2021-04-28T22:12:14-0700

Unfortunately, that means our beautiful leather-lined, LS-swapped 80 series needs a new home. We hope to not be selling outright with no trade, and are hoping someone has one or more of the following they no longer need, and need or want an 80 series, triple locked from the factory, with LS swap. However, we realize how difficult some of these items are to get and that you may only have cash, hence the cash price listed.  Price is 35k USD picked up in the Methow Valley. We really prefer local pickup in the Methow Valley. If you haven’t been, it is one of the more unique mountain towns.   However, if you would like delivered, we can deliver within AZ, NV, NM, CO, or UT for $1500. Any further and you’ll most likely need to arrange your own delivery.   If no one on here wants in the next few weeks, we plan to put on BringATrailer, but the end price will likely be higher. Wanted to open it up to real drivers on here first before it goes and sits in a 18 car garage to have wine spilt on it.   We prefer trades (plus cash on either end depending on what you’ve got) for the following: - Scamp or Casita or Airstream Bambi or Argosy trailer under 19’ - 1998 or later automatic Tacoma or Tundra 4x4 xtra or crew cab or T100 of similar vintage (or maybe a Nissan Frontier) - preferably with at least a 6’ bed - A newer daily driver Subaru Outback, Forester 2001 or later (or maybe a Toyota 4Runner) - Small or Medium 29er or 27.5” Hardtail or Full Suspension mountain or gravel bike(s), newer, prefer 1x11 or 1x12 drivetrain - NRS, Sol, or Hala paddle boards > 8 feet - Modern modular cabin / home or wood yurt 250 - 750 square feet (or a WA licensed contractor to build on site) - must meet current building code - Patented mining claim in Colorado, mountain land in Washington near Leavenworth, Winthrop, or similar, or land near Sun Valley or Driggs Idaho or Salt Lake City or Park City Utah  Land Cruiser has had a Western life (Texas, Washington) life. Many years of maintenance and upgrade paperwork available on paper and digitally. $45,000 + in documented work over past ~ 5 years   This is a 95 with stock: - Triple lockers (front, rear, center) - Luxury interior - leather and tortoise-looking stuff  - 3rd row seats  Extras: - ARB front bumper and Warn VR-S series winch (synthetic line) - $2100 installed - Custom diamond plate rear bumper with hitch, tire swing out, and 4-pin wiring harness - $1800 installed - Sliders - $600 installed  - 3” OME lift all around - $1575+ installed - Newer (5k miles) ~33” BFG KM3 tires ($1400 installed) on powder coated steel FJ rims  - LS swap engine 5.3L and 4L60e transmission (professionally done by The Land Cruiser Shop) - donor low-miles engine and rebuilt transmission. If you aren’t familiar with The Land Cruiser Shop, they are one of the top Land Cruiser shops in the West, and this work was beautiful (and pricey @ $25000). Includes emissions components. - Digital gauges that actually work and change colors for day / night driving - Newer ball joints and u joint - Newer front leather upholstery ($940 installed)  - Newer brakes ($450) - Newer AC w new compressor, condenser, and valves ($2000) - Newer fuel tank, fuel pump and lines ($950) - Full-sized spare  - Rebuilt birfields and replaced front drive shaft and u-joints ($1600) - Newer Rhino racks roof rack ($1200 installed) - Aftermarket cruise control  Plus a bunch of other stuff - too much to list into this vehicle  Body has about 280k miles. Lift, bumpers, rebuilt birfs, wheels, etc have much less obviously. Swap has about 630 miles since picked up from The Land Cruiser Shop.  If you have questions, want to share with a friend, or pick up, you can message me directly. I will review and if there are pertinent things that I am missing from the listing, I will update as needed.

I purchased this car from the second owner in October 2019 with 54,xxx on the odometer.  During my ownership, this car has treated me very well, and undergone several cross-country road trips.  I am only selling the vehicle because I purchased another wagon, and have no use for two.  Autocheck and Carfax reports, as well as a maintenance spreadsheet are available on request.   The car has a lot of options, including a panoramic glass roof, climate control, cruise control, heated steering wheel, sport seats, autodim mirrors, power windows and locks, xenon lights, among others. Tires are in decent shape, and the car is in excellent mechanical shape.  All maintenance and repairs are up to date, and I have receipts for all work done under my ownership.  Interior and exterior condition are good to excellent.  I’m happy to snap any additional pics.  Thanks for looking!  I do not need help selling this vehicle.",,az,35.1545,-111.6789,2021-04-25T19:30:14-0700

This Sedan has always been looked after and it shows! The car has always been garaged and is in awesome condition and is a lifelong Southern California car. This beast is powered by Audi's' legendary 4.2l V8 which has a reputation for creating serious power, especially when extenuated via the Quattro AWD drive train. This car sold for over $71,000 when new! This car was also special ordered without a sunroof which I have never seen before on over a dozen S4s I have sold! Don't miss your chance to own this beauty for a fraction of the original sticker.... SO BUY NOW!!  The following is a list of options as this S4 is currently equipped:  -340hp 4.2L V8 -Audi Quattro Drivetrain -18"" Audi S-Line Wheels -Like New Michelin Pilots -6 Speed Manual Transmission NEW CLUTCH! -Recaro Sport Bucket Seats -Multi Link Independent Suspension -Rear Air Vents -Power Auto Dimming Mirrors -Tire Pressure Monitoring System -Premium Bose Sound -Speed Sensitive Volume Control  The body on this sport sedan is in excellent condition overall. The car is finished in a beautiful Schwartz Gloss Black, which is an absolutely gorgeous color. The paint on the car has been garage kept and is overall very nice as it should be. The body on the car is totally straight and never had any collision repair. The rear bumper has a few scuffs and chips repaired, but thats really the only flaw on this car! The Overall condition of the exterior is a 9 out of 10! The interior is in great shape all around. The Black leather interior and Dark Wood trim is all very nice and shows minimal wear. All seats, door panels, and carpets are in very good condition and look great. The interior is extremely comfortable and well optioned. All accessories work inside the car including the Recaro sport seats, AmFm CD player, rear ac, etc. Overall condition of the interior is a 9 out of 10. The interior was all professionally detailed and it really shows! This is a lifetime non-smoker car and has no funny smells or stains. Mechanically, this S4 runs like a top. I can't describe how nice this car drives. It is extremely smooth and luxurious, but with the stomp of your foot you unleash all the power of the V8. The motor provides ample power to move the car around and you always have power on demand, especially with the Quattro drive train and that amazing 6-speed. Stopping this beast is just as important and is why the brakes are the S-Line performance variants. All correct accessories are in place and the motor has been completely cleaned and detailed to original condition. The car has just gone in to my European specialist for an oil change with Mobil 1 done and my service tech said it is one of the nicest S4's he has seen from this generation! The car also just received new front control arms, new clutch and new CV Axles! Over $4k in recent maintenance! She's ready for the road! All in all, this is one heck of a nice car to drive and will get compliments as well as stares everywhere it goes. This car is rarely seen on the road, especially in this color combination. This car truly brings the best of both words with performance and luxury. If you have been searching for a very nice S4 in the best color combo, the search ends here. The car was branded a California Lemon Law Buyback at 800 miles due to some engine issues. The original selling dealer bought car back, filed a warranty claim with Audi and replaced the complete engine and transmission ( I called my Audi service rep to verify)! The car was then sold as a Certified Preowned and the most recent owner has had no issues since they bought it in 2005! If you have any additional questions please call Jon at 480-703-2337. The car is located in beautiful sunny Scottsdale, AZ. Please email or call with any questions and I welcome international bidders! I can also help with shipping quotes and arrangements.

This week Canyon State Classics brings to market a flawless 2015 Range Rover Supercharged that runs and drives just like a new vehicle. The truck has spent its entire life in Walnut, CA area under the watchful eyes of its two owners. This car is ready to drive and doesn't need a thing. The big Brit was always well maintained and dealer serviced with Mobil 1 synthetic. It features many desirable options like Navigation, Heated Seats, Vision Assist and Driver Parking Assist, Harman Kardon premium sound, Panoramic Roof Sirius Radio and Active Xenon headlamps. And dont forget about the big 5.0L with a blower and big Brembo braking system The MSRP of this Range was almost $110,000 new, and here is your chance to own it for well under half original price at only 6 years old!!  Here are a few things Car and Driver had to say about this beauty:  The 2014 Range Rover Supercharged lineup has a number of chassis tweaks that improve its ride and handling. New adaptive shock absorbers are said to continually adjust to provide a compliant ride, as well as stiffen to minimize body roll. However, both the HSE and the Supercharged still exhibit a good amount of lean when thrown into corners with verve. Supercharged versions get a new ""dynamic"" setting for the Terrain Response system that stiffens the adaptive shocks even more, increases the responsiveness of the throttle, and accesses a more aggressive transmission program that holds gears longer and will downshift under hard braking in an attempt to set the vehicle up for a corner. Should the driver want even more control, Supercharged models have paddle shifters behind the steering-wheel spokes.  Even though the power of the new engines doesn't quite translate into class-leading acceleration, the Range Rover's revised interior truly separates it from the competition. Anything that isn't wood-trimmed or covered by leather is made of high-quality materials that we found ourselves mindlessly caressing. The basic design of the sweeping center console remains, but all the switchgear has been improved and modernized. The Range Rover's cabin is perhaps its best and most unique feature; it's on the same level as an Aston Martin or Rolls-Royce interior. A few minutes in the new ambience are nearly enough to forget about the SUVs quicker competitors.  The list of some of the equipment:  - 5.0L 510hp Supercharged 8-Cyl.        - Automatic Transmission w/ Paddle Shifters - 4 Wheel Brembo Disc Brakes - Dual Zone Auto Climate Control - Harman Kardon LOGIC 7 Premium Sound - Satellite Radio ($400) - 22"" OEM Range Rover Wheels w/ Continental Tires - Vision Assist Package ($1760) - Driver Assist Package ($1560) - HID Xenon Active Headlamps - Heated Accessory Package - Sunroof - Parking Assist - Navigation - Factory Rear DVD - Adaptive Cruise Control ($1295) - Power Seats - Telescoping Steering - Power windows - Power mirrors - Power Locks      The body on the Rover is in like new condition and was well maintained. The paint on the car is mostly original and in awesome condition and looks as good as the day in rolled of the lot. The car is finished in gorgeous Indus Silver and looks amazing going down the road. The body is literally perfect with no a dent ding or chip. The 22"" SV wheels are like new and look awesome. The tires are 50% Continentals. Overall the exterior appearance of this car is a 10 out of 10.     The interior is in like new shape all around. The Cirrus Gray Nappa premium leather seats are all in very good condition with no tares or rips and absolutely no wear to the driver seat which shows the quality of leather used in this car. The wood and stainless surfaces is in excellent condition. The carpets are all very nice. The two sets of floor mats are also like new. All dials and controls function as they should. The sound system is also very nice with Premium LOGIC 7 sound as well as the CD changer. The car is smoke free so there are no odors or burns and still smells like new fine leather and materials.     Mechanically, this Range is in great condition and runs and drives great. It has the legendary Jaguar Co-Engineered Supercharged 5.0L V8 and a 6-Speed automatic transmission that shifts perfect. The car has always been serviced at authorized Range Rover dealership and needs absolutely nothing. This car is freshly detailed and really shows how its current owner took excellent care of it. The truck was just put through our specialty shop and had a full once over including lube oil and filter.      The car includes two set of keys and remote as well as all the original manuals, as well as the full size spare, and all tools.     All in all, this is one of the cleanest and nicest Range Rovers that we have had the privilege of being associated with. It has been professionally maintained and truly loved by its current owner. This Range is a fantastic value for the price and includes almost every option offered in this car. This is your chance to get a high-end Range for a fraction of the cost and well below blue book. If you have been dreaming of owning the Range Rover Flagship, than look no further.

Starts and runs great! Rust free and everything works, but it’s also a 27 year old adventure rig, so it’s not pristine. Fun Jeep, but I have too many vehicles! Clean AZ registration.   The good: Engine upgrades:  Baja beast cam, 24lb injectors, Fuel pro water separator, Walbro fuel pump, steel braided fuel lines, rough country tb spacer, high flow exhaust, electronic fans, new Optima red top battery  Suspension upgrades:  Front: Dana 44 axle by Currie (trussed by Clavicle 3) with chromoly shafts and Dynatrac ball joints, 5.13 gears, RuffStuff custom long arm kit, Fox remote reservoir shocks and RC springs, Rubicon Express SYE, JKS quick disconnects Rear: Ford 9 in. axle  (by Currie) with 35 spline shafts, Strange engineering nodular 3rd member with 5.13 gears, Yukon Grizzly locker, Bilstein shocks with through-the-floor shock towers and Deaver 11 leaf race springs  Interior:  Aftermarket steering wheel, Grand Cherokee ZJ front and rear seats, new carpet, 98+ XJ center console with cup holders, accessory switchboard, Bluetooth stereo  Misc: On-board air, CB radio, 50” led light bar, Vision X light pods, custom steel bumpers and rock sliders, ARES rear quarter armor, Dirtbound Offroad unibody frame stiffeners (rear is installed, front is not), 8k winch with Dyneema 100’ synthetic line, LED rock lights, 35x12.5x15 Hercules MT tires on ProComp wheels, Garvin roof rack with spare tire mount  The bad: Paint is rough. Glass is intact, but pretty rough. The window sills have scratched the glass and there is old, cut up, purple tint. The P.O. put in the ZJ seats and cut too much off the rear seat so it looks weird and sloppy. Emergency brake is disconnected. Front passenger door was replaced so key doesn’t match lock and instead of fixing the power window motor, someone put in a manual window control.",,az,35.198,-111.651,2021-04-23T11:42:13-0700

Being a Lexus, you can be confident that it is the best quality vehicle available. We see these go through auctions with more than 300,000 miles, so the 106K miles on this one means you can expect this car to last a whole lot longer. And, this thing is LOADED: leather, heated power seats (with memory for the driver), power pretty much everything, power tilting AND telescoping steering wheel, moon roof, and more. Did you notice that it's all wheel drive? The interior is extremely clean, with no evidence of smoking or pets (there is some damage on the front seats, so we have ordered replacement leather).  Everything works, and it drives excellent. This Lexus was priced at about $50,000 when new, so our price, at about a third of that, is a real bargain. Don’t wait…cars this nice sell quickly!

And, of course, this 5.9 liter Cummins HO will run and run and run…and get good mileage in the process. Did you notice that it’s a 4X4?  This truck runs and drives as good as it looks.  I’m not going to tell you this truck is “like new”, but it just might be the nicest 15 year old truck we have ever had. Don’t wait…trucks this nice sell quickly…don’t wait till someone from Michigan calls and ships it home (unless, of course, you are reading this from Michigan…)  Call, e-mail, or come in and drive this one right away…you will not be disappointed! We will make it easy for you to get your next car!

That way, our customers become our friends, and most of our business results from referrals. We’re happy, you’re happy…we all win!

And, the bed IS a bedliner with a hidden, waterproof storage bin under the bed.

Montreal Metallic Blue. These are generally considered to be some of the best cars BMW has ever made, and they're quickly becoming classics. 110k original miles. Mechanically the car is as close to perfect as you could ask for. It has not been neglected, and I have extensive service documents including the original build sheet. Runs and drives beautifully, everything works. The paint on the hood and roof is faded.  Lots of significant maintenance done in the last few years, including timing chain guides and tensioners which is a big deal on these cars. Suspension has been completely went over and replaced. Newer tires. Oil and transmission fluid changed. Cooling system overhaul a couple years ago. Does not leak or consume any fluids.  I'm selling because I am moving and cannot take it with me. This is a wonderful car that I wouldn't hesitate to drive anywhere. Clear title in my name.  show contact info  Calls or texts welcome.",,az,34.894205,-111.874246,2021-04-22T15:22:52-0700

This truck spent its whole life in Flagstaff.  The bed has some rust but the cab is solid.  This is a project than runs and drives but should be trailered home.  I bought it with a bad transmission that I replaced with a used one from a buddies CJ7.  Then realized the freeze plugs were blown so pulled the motor to replace those.  The heater core froze too so it is currently bypassed.  The engine runs good and idles smooth but has excessive crankshaft endplay which causes the torque converter bolts to scrape the engine backing plate which makes a lot of noise.  I have the original fenders and hood but they are really rough.  Plan was to do a flatbed and LS conversion but plans change.  Great project for the FSJ or Wagoneer enthusiast.  $3000 firm",,az,35.174308,-111.601057,2021-04-22T15:20:22-0700

The Fiero was designed by George Milidrag and Hulki Aldikacti as a sports car. It was the first two-seater Pontiac since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and the first mass-produced mid-engine sports car by an American manufacturer. Many technologies incorporated in the Fiero design, such as composite panels, were radical for their time. Other features included hidden headlamps and, initially, integrated stereo speakers in the driver and passenger headrests. Car is in good running condition. Exterior paint is faded but good. Interior is good but needs some cosmetic restoration. Truly an American classic to own and hard to find with such low mileage.
