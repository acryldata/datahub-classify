The truck is stock and has had regular maintenance conducted. Weather Tech Mats are installed and included and have made a huge difference in preserving the vehicle. The title is Clean and the truck has not been in any Car Accidents. It does has signs of use like small scratches and dents however they are small and the Cement Gray body color helps reduce their visibility.

The good: engines only got 97,000 miles on it, runs strong, shifts great, steerings tight, has new plugs, wires, and coil pack, good tires (bought new a few years ago and have put low miles on them), and interior is in great shape.   The bad: its a northeast car and has rust on the rear wheel wells and underside of the car, has typical dings and scratches for a car this old, exhaust is rusted and will need to be replaced (muffler is supported on one side by tie wire), brakes are very soft and needs pads and rotors all the way around (particularly the rear which have started to grind), ABS light recently came on, check engine light throws a minor evap leak code, CD stuck in the CD player, has developed a passive electricity drain (if it sits for a few weeks it may need to be jump started but doesn't happen when driven daily), and it leaks oil (most likely from the valve cover gaskets) onto the exhaust, which results in under hood smoke. Theres an open recall on the passenger air bag, I've tried numerous times to get the Subaru dealer in Columbus to replace this, but they always have an excuse for why the can't do it or say they'll call with an appointment and never do and I stopped trying once it was no longer my daily driver.  It books for $3600 in fair condition, but considering the work it needs am asking $2100 or best offer. The car was a reliable daily driver for me for 5 years and could continue to be with a new exhaust, pads and rotors, and valve cover gaskets. It could also be a great parts car for someone looking for a good engine, transmission, and seats.",,al,32.5475,-85.4682,2021-04-20T09:55:48-0500

The F-Series was born with the vision of satisfying the average American’s need for a utility vehicle with daily driver comforts.  I rebuilt this beauty with the help of a few specialists. The chrome and bright work has been revitalized to reflective perfection. Skins bear clean and stylish whitewalls that circle classic and original hub caps. Mostly stock, the interior was completely refurbished during the restoration in black and gray. Gauges were modified to incorporate an electronic Dakota cluster, retaining the dash and classic look. Shifting remains as the ‘three on the tree’ setup. 1954 was the first year of Ford’s entry into the over-head valve world with its ‘Y’ block 239. Believed to be numbers matching and thus original, the motor has gone through a complete rebuild and tasteful modifications include a 4 bbl. Carb. Drivability was improved with modified electric power steering. Electrical system was upgraded to incorporating an alternator and 12V wiring throughout. This is no Trailer Queen but she does have a crown, or should I say, crowning achievement as the Best in Class. And the drive and award was repeated in 2016.  $27,000.00 or best offer  If you have any other questions please feel free to reach out.   -Zack",,al,33.5363,-87.051,2021-05-03T13:18:33-0500

Triple Black Car with  20 options ordered special by the Chief of Police in Homewood Alabama for his personal duty car. Fresh Black paint in great shape. The car was always an unmarked car. Locals called it the ""Bat Car"".      9C1 being the designation for the Police Car which is most common as 4 door sedans and ordered thru the Fleet System of GM. This car being a Two Door coupe with the 350 High Performance V8 and HD Turbo 350 transmission and Positraction rear end. Car has the optional 120MPH speedo, AC, Full dash instrumentation, power steering and Brakes.  This car was ordered under the COPO designation by the Cheif himself. As the Chiefs car it was well maintained and never wrecked. High back special bucket seats are much different than the civilian version. 350 V8 was only available in Police cars.      I have only seen one other 9C1 two door and it was a race car, stripped of the original equipment and with no Factory Documentation like the original Build sheet, window sticker and factory invoice from Chevrolet Historic Department. I also have three copies of the Original Build Sheet.      2018 I participated in the HOT ROD Power tour with this car. Chevy never built a Malibu SS in 1979 but if they did, it would look like this car. Drive it anywhere!      I can guarentee you will not see one of these at any car show. G Bodies are just cool!

Reduced, make an offer, liquidation, et al/etc. Solid, correct, fairly original Saab 900 Turbo.  16 valve version, 5 speed.   Motor is solid, Transaxle good.  No mechanical issues a shop manual and some Saturdays can't fix.  Good glass all around NO RUST in pans, !!!! Small amount of cosmetic rust where sunroof leaked and kept headliner insulation wet for a decade or so.    Very driveable, no scary suspension or driveline issues.    Interior is tired, but basically there.    I've always liked these things, they were the 'different' choice for a sports sedan way back.    It's got some creative plumbing, and the clear coat is MIA in a lot of spaces.  Make a rat rod, restore it, drive it as is.  These things are super scarce now. My storage is going away along with my wife's enthusiasm.    Bought new in Bham so it's been local.    BRAND NEW Goodyear Eagle tires all round.    THIS IS REALISTICALY A PROJECT CAR.  It's road worthy, but needs some TLC.  I am willing to deliver for a fee if you don't want to drive it or if you lack a tow vehicle.    It's not appropriate for a Nigerian Uncle, and I'm uninterested in trades.    Email with any questions, or specific photos.  I'll gladly talk with anyone that can demonstrate human behavior.

I have replaced the battery, radiator, thermostat, engine coolant temp sensor, brake master cylinder, plugs, plug wires and fuel filter since I purchased it.  Also installed a new Pioneer receiver and speakers. It has the SOHC VTEC D1626 engine and is fun to drive.  The hard top lifts off and stores in a special rack in the trunk.

If ad is up, truck is available.  2006 Ford F-150 2 door with 8' long bed 4.2L V6 gas engine, Automatic Transmission. Transmission won't go in reverse. 246,000 miles. Trailer hitch, electric brake controller. No a/c but heat works well. Clean Title, NO LIENS. 2.5"" front lift, and 3"" rear lift.  This is a work truck. Its not the cutest looking, but it has been my daily driver for years. Manual windows and door locks. It has some dings and scratches on the bed, driver door sides, and tailgate. I bought it like that 5 years ago. I change the oil regularly, and have kept it as mechanically sound as I can.  I was pulling a camper out of a sandy pasture in Orlando Florida, and the transmission quit going in reverse. The truck still drove 9 hours all the way back to Alabama, (600 mile journey) which is impressive to me. I still drive this truck as it is, I just can't park in certain spots, because my reverse doesn't work.  Oh well. It's up for sale. You can bring a trailer or drive it back home. Remember, it doesn't go in reverse, so you'll have to park it somewhere that you can drive forward out.  Uploaded pictures are of the truck, working and making money. You can see the dents in the side .  First $3500 OBO takes it Call or text me at  show contact info  Located in Oxford Al. Can arrange delivery if you buy it.

Source: Edmunds  * Introducing a feat of engineering previously thought to be impossible: the crossover without compromise. Not only does the CX-5 offer confident driving, all-weather capability, spaciousness and advanced features, but it does so with amazing highway MPG. CX-5's aerodynamic curves and sloping roofline reduce wind turbulence and allow for the vehicle's weight to be distributed toward the rear axle for increased stability. CX-5 is packed with advanced features that adjust to your driving needs, such as available rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, and 17 to 19 inch aluminum alloy wheels fitted with all-season tires. CX-5 features two transmission options: the ultra-responsive 6-speed manual and the 6-speed Sport automatic. With CX-5's SKYACTIV-G 2.0L engine it produces 155hp and an impressive 150 lb-ft torque delivering up to an EPA estimated 35 MPG hwy with manual and 32 with automatic transmissions. For extra power and torque, upgrade to the surprisingly fuel-efficient 2.5L SKYACTIV-G with 184hp. The 2.5L also allows for the option of AWD. The CX-5 blends sophisticated details, like available double stitched premium leather trimmed seats, a power moonroof, and ample passenger and cargo volume (64.8 cubic feet) to create a stylish all-purpose cabin. Crisp, immersive sound is delivered through an available 9 speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System with AudioPilot noise compensation technology. Connect your iPod or other MP3 device with the USB audio input or auxiliary jack. CX-5 offers available HD Radio, Pandora Internet radio connectivity and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

The water pump and belts were replaced in august when the compresser was replaced so no issues there. Has new tires & 1"" wider wheels on front & back. Has a Corsa axel back exhaust system. The car has been lowered somewhat of aftermarket lowering bolts but can be removed & the original bolts can be re-installed. Could use some rear shocks to help the stiff ride. There is 1 tear in the drivers side seat & it will also need foam replaced. The car drives great & will go anywhere you want.

Source: KBB.com  * Agreeable ride quality; generous cargo capacity; seating for up to eight. Source: Edmunds  * Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. For 2014 the Traverse adds twin USB ports for 2nd-row passengers to keep electronic devices powered up. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The 2014 Chevy Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. The Traverse has a look that is cohesive with Chevrolet's famiOptionsPreferred Equipment Group 1LS., 6 Speakers.,                    AM/FM radio: SiriusXM.,         CD player.,                     MP3 decoder.,                   Radio data system.,             SiriusXM Satellite Radio.,      Standard Speaker System.,       Air Conditioning.,              Rear air conditioning.,         Rear window defroster.,         Bluetooth® For Phone.,         Power steering.,                Power windows.,                 Remote keyless entry.,          Traction control.,              4-Wheel Disc Brakes.,           ABS brakes.,                    Airbags.,                       Dual front impact airbags.,     Front anti-roll bar.,           Low tire pressure warning.,     Occupant sensing airbag.,       Overhead airbag.,               Rear anti-roll bar.,            Brake assist.,                  Electronic Stability Control.,  Exterior Parking Camera Rear.,  Delay-off headlights.,          Fully automatic headlights.,    Panic alarm.,                   Security system.,               Speed control.,                 Bodyside moldings.,             Bumpers: body-color.,           Integral Spotter Mirrors.,      Power door mirrors.,            Roof rack: rails only.,         Spoiler.,                       Compass.,                       Driver door bin.,               Driver vanity mirror.,          Front reading lights.,          Illuminated entry.,             Outside temperature display.,   Passenger vanity mirror.,       Premium Cloth Seat Trim.,       Rear reading lights.,           Rear seat center armrest.,      Tachometer.,                    Telescoping steering wheel.,    Tilt steering wheel.,           Trip computer.,                 Voltmeter.,                     3rd row seats: split-bench.,    Front Bucket Seats.,            Reclining Front Bucket Seats.,  Split folding rear seat.,       Passenger door bin.,            17'' x 7.5'' Steel Wheels.,     Rear window wiper.,             Variably intermittent wipers.,  3.16 Axle Ratio.,               **CLEAN CARFAX**.,              **ONE-OWNER**.,                 **LOCAL TRADE**.,               Front License Plate Bracket Mounting Package.,                  Radio: Color Touch AM/FM/HD/CD Player.,                         Enhanced Driver Information Center.,                            Steering wheel mounted audio controls.,                         Comfort Grip Urethane Steering Wheel.,                          Four wheel independent suspension.,                             8-Passenger Seating (2-3-3 Seating Configuration).,               phone:      ☎ (205) 862-8003 text:       Text (205) 862-8003 for more details  link:       https://19464.bestusedcarmarket.com/v/44405461/2/22302184  contact:    Gary Johnston   DisclaimerPlease call or text me anytime between 8am and 9pm daily if you have any questions on my inventory or finance options.

Motor is solid, Transaxle good.  No mechanical issues a shop manual and some Saturdays can't fix.  Good glass all around NO RUST in pans, !!!! Small amount of cosmetic rust where sunroof leaked and kept headliner insulation wet for a decade or so.    Very driveable, no scary suspension or driveline issues.    Interior is tired, but basically there.    I've always liked these things, they were the 'different' choice for a sports sedan way back.    It's got some creative plumbing, and the clear coat is MIA in a lot of spaces.  Make a rat rod, restore it, drive it as is.  These things are super scarce now. My storage is going away along with my wife's enthusiasm.    Bought new in Bham so it's been local.    BRAND NEW Goodyear Eagle tires all round.    THIS IS REALISTICALY A PROJECT CAR.  It's road worthy, but needs some TLC.  I am willing to deliver for a fee if you don't want to drive it or if you lack a tow vehicle.    It's not appropriate for a Nigerian Uncle, and I'm uninterested in trades.    Email with any questions, or specific photos.  I'll gladly talk with anyone that can demonstrate human behavior.

See window sticker for more details. Three owners since new: the original owner, my mother, and me. Overall this is a nice, clean car. However, it may need a new head gasket (more on this below). Otherwise the car still starts and runs. It was my daily driver until about six months ago. I’m selling it now only because I have too many vehicles and no longer need this one.   The Good:   New parts within the past 2 - 3 years: battery, starter, battery cables, spark plugs, spark plug wires, water pump, thermostat, radiator flush, anti-freeze/coolant, A/C bearing, serpentine belt, front disc brake pads. Tires are in very good condition. Gets about 25 MPG combined city and highway. No known wrecks (it was bumped once in the rear bumper). Other than a few stains (see below), this is a very clean car inside and out. Sale includes a 3-volume set of GM Dealer service manuals and most of the parts and service records since December, 2000.  The Bad:   The engine may need a new head gasket. Although it doesn’t overheat and doesn’t smoke, the engine will occasionally stall; it still runs when it stalls but feels like it may have water in the gas and looses power. The air conditioner does not work (don’t know what the problem is, may just need refrigerant). Fuel gauge does not work (common defect with some GM vehicles of this era). The “Low Coolant Level” dash light comes on/goes off randomly, even if the coolant level is topped off. The “Check Engine” dash light comes on/goes off randomly.  The Ugly:  There are two cracks in the windshield. The paint is peeling and flaking in some areas (another common defect with some GM vehicles of this era). The carpet has a few light stains. There is one place in the carpet beneath the emergency brake that shows heavy wear and tear. And there are some stains in the middle section of the back seat (yes, each of my kids had a “drinking problem” when they were in booster seats).   $1100 cash only. NO trades.   Please do not contact me unless you are interested in buying this car. I do not need any help selling it and I will report all spam and scams to Craigslist.",,al,33.20968,-86.783409,2021-04-23T16:54:26-0500

Source: KBB.com  * Generous standard equipment; comfortable and quiet highway ride; good value. Source: Edmunds  * The new Lincoln MKC blends the best traits of a sport crossover with the refinement of a luxury sedan. It begins with the classic Lincoln grille reimagined. Wings spread outward to frame dramatic HID headlamps with signature LED accents. Crisp lines stretch taut across the sculpted body. The low roof and high beltline evoke an athletic nature. Available 19 or 20 inch wheels make a bold statement while padded inner wheel wells soften the sound of the road. Premium materials like authentic aluminum and available wood trim enhance rich, soft-touch surfaces. An available expansive Vista Roof offers a wide-open look at the world above. No matter where the road leads, the Lincoln MKC will carry you and your cargo comfortably, with available Bridge of Weir Deepsoft leather-trimmed seating for five and available 25.2 cu. ft. of rear cargo space. Choose from 2 available options including the 2.3L EcoBoost offering 285hp and 305 lb.-ft. of torque or the 2.0L EcoBoost providing 240hp and 270 lb.-ft. of torque. Other features include adaptive cruise control which uses sensor to detect cars in front of you and adjust cruise control speed and distance. When activated, the Lane-Keeping System can detect when the car is drifting out of its lane and warn you. Active noise control heightens overall cabin sound quality by reducing unwanted noises while enhancing desired sound.

This truck is probably one of the most elaborate trucks we have ever owned with upgrades beyond description.  Truck has six batteries stereo system with 20+ speakers, more amps than you can count, custom pearl three dimensional paint (that detailed does not even begin to describe).  We have owned thousands of custom trucks none compared to this one.  Previous owner was as meticulous as they get and spared zero expenses.

For those that haven’t priced a monster unit like this, this truck would cost you about $200,000 after stretching just basic build, and then another $100,000 plus in paint, stereo and custom upgrades.  Not to mention the one plus year wait time to build if not longer.  Hands-down one of the most elaborate eye-catching units there is and the best part is if this one does not suit your fancy we have plenty of others including some additional six doors.

It was traded into the Toyota dealership after being with the previous owner since March of 2015 with 9k miles. The engine is quiet and strong, transmission shifts perfect, steering is tight, suspension is great, a/c blows cold, heat blows hot, brakes stop on a dime, tires are like new, all electronics work as they should, there are no engine codes or any other problematic dash lights on, no odors, no leaks, no rust and no body damage other than a few small scratches on the rear bumper. You truly have to see and drive this thing to appreciate the way it has been cared for. I drove this over 500 miles (9 hours straight) and did not have a single issue with it.  The 4-Wheel-Drive System works flawlessly and this 4Runner comes equipped to tackle any obstacle in its path, however it has never been off the pavement.  The following aftermarket parts are in like-new condition:  - Rancho RS99970 Quicklift Coil Over Shock Absorbers with 9-Position Manual/Remote MYRIDE Tuning Technology - BDS Suspension FOX Shocks - 17x9 Method Race Wheels - LT285/70R17 Mastercraft Courser AXT2 - SLEE Rock Slider Steps - WeatherTech Floor Liners  This 4Runner comes with navigation, backup camera, Bluetooth, USB, towing package, powered driver seat, automatic power windows and power locks, keyless entry, two-tone cloth seats, projector headlights, fog lights, led tail lights and much more! Keep in mind this is the year that the 5th Gen 4Runners had a major cosmetic upgrade (look at the front of a 2010-2013 if you don’t know what I’m talking about).  If you have read this far I am sure you are wondering the mileage. It has 231k miles and drives as good if not better than the day it drove off the lot. I’m not joking, this suspension is top notch. Save yourself THOUSANDS from buying one with less mileage and get this one inspected by anyone you would like and I promise you won’t be disappointed! This one has been babied it’s entire life and it really does show...  CarFax Retail Value on this 4Runner with this mileage is $22,550 before taxes and fees are added in. My price includes all fees. This price also does not factor in the cost of the aftermarket accessories that have been installed.
