A refined 4-cylinder engine offers respectable fuel economy due in part to the new 9-speed automatic transmission. If it’s power you seek, the Pentastar V6 serves up 295 horsepower. Source: KBB.com * Strong V6 engine composed ride and handling high-quality interior materials slick infotainment interface available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds * The advanced engineering of the redesigned 2015 Chrysler 200 results in highly efficient, refined performance. The exterior design blends coupe-like proportions with a tasteful fit and finish. A dynamic stance, wind-swept profile, finely sculpted curves and aggressive wheel-to-body proportions result in a sophisticated road presence. The 200 redefines the sedan interior. A traditional center console is replaced with one that is ergonomic and space efficient. It combines climate controls, the Electric Park Brake and connectivity functions with storage features. A connection to a USB or auxiliary media hub is located under the cup holder. Controls for the available dual-zone automatic temperature control are in short reach and easy to use. The 200 fuel economic ratings speak for themselves. The 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir II four-cylinder engine provides up to 36mpg HWY, while the available 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine delivers up to 31mpg HWY with 295hp. The Rotary E-shift features a wide gear ratio spread provides smooth, indecipherable transfer between gears at all speeds. Standard on all 200 models (except the LX) the Uconnect 5.0 System includes a high-resolution 5in touchscreen, one year of SiriusXM Radio, Integrated Voice Command, Bluetooth technology, a media hub with mobile device integration and more.

First the negative...salvage title..only because it was stolen and stripped 6 years ago..car faxs will show that and no accidents or air bag deployment. With no accident reports the title thing did not bug me. So now the good. Long bed extended cab. 2500 Laramie. First year of 24 valve, it was a mid year change ( from 12 valve) , thus the listing of 98.5 as the year. To some the most desirable version called a 2nd generation. In past few years ( 9k miles ago) it has had..d&b turbo and d&b push pump. 5 inch exhaust.100 hp injectors .fuel dog fuel pump and filters. adrenalin programmer and iquad management system...currently set at stage 1..programmable by smart phone...plus let's you check boost...temps...etc ..etc.Cold air k&n filter. Tensioner was sloppy so just installed new water pump, tensioner, thermostat, belt and coolant. Radiator about 2 years old. Synthetic oil change about 1500 miles ago. Recent costco batteries and a new alternator. Extra grounds installed...another issue these rigs can develop with triggering check engine lights etc but not a potential issue now with extra grounds. I recently bought ARP studs, not installed...so I can bump to stage 2 and increase HP. Suspension has a redhead steering box and steering box frame cross brace with a fox stabilizer. Heim joints. This gets rid of "" death wobble"" these rigs develop. Tranny was rebuilt and a new torque converter..both extreme duty...all heavy duty..11k ago. Rest of suspension is fox shocks...3 inch lift and overload springs..on very good 17 inch bf goodrich ko tires. Custom wheels with special order 7 spline lock lug nuts.Front brakes just got new rotors calipers and hoses as well as one new hub. Rears are fine... Installed CAD to eliminate the vacuum front 4wd actuator. so they are now mechanical.( far superior) Has overload springs...plug in for camper and a 5th wheel set up.. Set for overlanding..has a big solar panel on roof of ARE canopy ... 2 big deep cycle batteries ( plus the 2 in engine compartment, so 4 total) and a 4000 watt inverter. Have the stock tailgate too if you want to remove canopy ( for using 5th wheel etc) . Also has a removable ladder system to get to roof rack ( not shown) Interior is good...electric seat works and has new drivers foam and factory match fabric cover...but not installed...got weeks ago...dash is about 4 years old and has NO CRACKS. Kenwood stereo and speakers...new door weather stripping..sound deading mats in doors and rear panels to control outside noise and viper remote start and door locks about 2 years old. Smoked LED headlights and smoked led cab roof lights. Heated towing mirrors , electrical aim. Factory block heater. Recently bought oil pan and trans pan heaters but have not yet installed. If much of this in new information to you, or 300k bugs you,,,then you dont know these dodge cummins diesels. Got this to be my out and about back woods cruiser but reluctantly have to sell as I need to finish my living space and Im an old fart on a limited budget. It has no issues...no coolant or fluid leaks... other than Cruise control not working. Never needed it (or liked) so did not try to figure out why but its all there. Some small extra new parts included.   Starts right up, runs better than a stock dodge diesel . My last fully loaded trip from anchorage to here..last fall...was getting near 20mpg. Worst ive ever gotten was about 15....have gotten 22.  Alaska title in hand. Permanent plates  Pictures are as of the other day but random order.

You found the right vehicle ad.  This is my beloved 2016 Nissan Titan XD diesel, with the 5.0L Cummins powering it. With this rig, I successfully traveled to all 50 states AND all the Canadian provinces, in a row, solo. The truck never let me down and in fact averaged 17.6mpg for those 34,000 miles. Current odometer: approximately 92,000 miles (it will go up slightly as I drive it).  This rig is the dream overlanding vehicle. You can go anywhere, tow anything, and do everything with it. It got me up here in October of 2019 (towing my cargo trailer through the Rockies in early snow season without any problem). Unfortunately, I injured my shoulder and cannot camp or do other heavy physical projects for a long time. I would like this truck to delight someone else, who can use it to the fullest.  I have done meticulous maintenance on this truck. This Titan XD is also fully winterized better than most vehicles up here (2 electric heating battery blankets; transmission pan heater; oil pan heater; OEM coolant heater for the block). Living in North Pole on the Chena, this truck started right up at -45 degree ambient temps. Nothing will stop it.  There are a huge number of mods and added accessories with this sale: * Rocky Road rock sliders (2"" square tubing, the rock will break before the truck does) * Iron Bull 500 lb front bumper and matching rear (you will turn heads AND be safe from moose) * multiple LED flood lights and light bars integrated in the front bumper, and aux reverse lights in the rear bumper * tuned and deleted engine with all original exhaust components included (adjustable tune on the fly) * upgraded S&B air intake with 2 reusable filters, dust cover, adjustable airflow based on air temps * Mishimoto oil catch can * Mishimoto coolant filter * integrated Amsoil secondary oil filter (adding 1 quart of oil capacity, slow flow, removes 99% of particulates down to 2 microns) * a third 12v battery (deep discharge) under the bed rails so you can operate equipment without a generator... and it charges off the alternator... and can be used to jumpstart the truck if needed. * Interior power inverter with a 120V outlet * Nissan bed utility items (UtiliTrak system; tie-down cleats; OEM integrated gooseneck hitch; bed extender cage for the tailgate, LED bed lights; 120V outlet) * OEM fold-away rear bumper step * phenomenal Mag-Hytec rear differential cover (increased capacity, adds a drain and fill plug, magnetic filter on the fill plug) for effortless towing maintenance * second full-sized spare tire * Carhartt-brand grey duckweave fitted seat covers (front and back, these are indestructible) * Weathertech fitted floormats and low-profile window vents * front-facing dash camera * Titan XD diesel-specific ScanGauge (see engine data, scan codes, and more while on the go) * fitted summer (keep bugs out) and winter (keep warmth in) covers for the front grille * Spare parts (oil filter, transfer tank fuel filter, serpentine belt, more) and unstarted projects (such as a kit to make the mirror turn signals into running lights)  **Note: transfer tank NOT included. Pictures taken 4/15/2021 before I had a chance to pull the tank out of the bed.**  There are many other details and components. This is, as I said, the dream rig for self-sufficient exploring and towing in comfort and safety. Please reach out with any questions.   ____  I am also selling my Tepui Tents rooftop tent. I can offer a discount if you buy both the truck and the tent - search ""Kukenam"" to see that ad.",,ak,64.7805,-147.3694,2021-04-16T14:21:11-0800
