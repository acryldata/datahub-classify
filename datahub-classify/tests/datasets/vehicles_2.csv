Odometer is 29319 miles below market average! 21/34 City/Highway MPGAwards:  * Green Car Journal 2014 Green Car of the Year   * 2014   Brand Image AwardsKelley Blue Book Brand Image Awards are based on the Brand Watch(tm) study from Kelley Blue Book Market Intelligence.

Your mileage will vary depending on how you drive and maintain your vehicle, driving conditions and other factors.Reviews:  * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source:    * The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the 2014 Accord comes in a Hybrid version as well. This operates on a 141-hp 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55-hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy. To help maximize efficiency on the road, the Accord Hybrid seamlessly shifts between three distinct drive modes: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive and Engine Drive. EV Drive is 100% electric, and generally is used during braking and when starting from a stop. Hybrid Drive uses the fuel engine and electric motor to provide extra zip during acceleration, and once your Accord Hybrid is cruising with highway efficiency, Engine Drive takes over. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with the Accord.

Transmission filter has been changed with new fluids 13. Front and rear pumpkin oils have just been changed 14. Dash instrument control pump for front brakes. ** I will throw in the original 4 wheels and tires 265/ R70/17  Prior to doing all this work the vehicle had only 180,000. Motor is new and is slightly broken in with 700 miles from break-in oil, oil has now been changed. Break in time should be around 5,000. Blocks, heads and crankshafts are 100% magnaflux tested to avoid cracked components. Crankshaft is checked for size, reground, if necessary, and micro polished to OEM specifications. Camshaft is reground, and micro polished to OEM specifications. Connecting rods have new bushings installed and both large and small end are re-machined to OEM specifications. All connecting rods are de-magnetized. Both heads new valves and are vacuum tested to ensure the quality of the valve job. Both heads were pressure tested. Core plugs are 100% stainless steel to avoid corrosion. Long Block Includes: Block, Crankshaft, Camshaft, Pistons/rings, Timing gears, Connecting rods, Lifters, Main/rod bearings, Piston cooling tubes, Cam bearings, Valve train, Cylinder heads/valves, New Oil pan & pick-up tube, Oil pump, Oil Cooler, Front Cover, Rear Cover - Ford. Water Pump, Valve Covers. Injectors, Vibration damper, Glow plugs, High pressure oil pump, High pressure oil rails, Injection pressure regulator valve, Crankshaft position sensor, ICP Injection control pressure sensor, Camshaft position sensor, Engine oil pressure sensor, EOT.  Engine is basically new with all new parts - Engine oil temperature sensor new and a brand new Turbo.  I was advised by a highly qualified diesel company here in White City Oregon to have the California EGR emissions Valve blocked on this new motor for increased performance and ""for engine safety"". This is only for California emissions standards, it now passes all the the western states emission standards for licensing, an SCT Computer Tuner is needed to remove the EGR delete engine light, at a cost $600. Wolf Diesel performance company completed everything after the engine was installed. This SCT tuner rewrites the system and is married only to one motor. SO YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND, Removing the EGR valve is a major benefit to longevity and safety of a motor. This factory Valve is a smog valve only required in California and can cause real damage if the system begins to fail, as in a domino effect. This EGR robs the engine of a good air flow and failure can happen around 150,000 miles. When failure happens oil goes into the intake, then destroys the head gaskets, then the turbo fails and then the motor blows. All Diesels Systems should be flushed at 40-50 thousand miles to keep them clean. Oil Cooler replacement should be done at 120,000 miles to keep the safety of good cooling and motor safety. This New Turbo has special bearing, which have been upgraded to a more high performance for another extra motor performance and protection. I still have the old turbo for view. The Garett factory thrust bearings are of 270 degrees verses the new upgraded steel bearing that has 360 degrees on the shaft. Also this new turbo has a Gas Piston Ring, which is a better oil seal. Garret high performance, who sells Turbos now has much better parts then the original stock turbos that came from the Ford factory. That is what you will get if you buy a used diesel truck off some car lot. Garett high performance says that most Turbos should be rebuilt at around 180,000 miles. If a Turbo goes from either over use or from an EGR failure the metal from the Turbo can then take out the motor. With a good clean running motor and good maintained Diesel motor can run up to 750,000 miles. GARRETT - POWERMAX TURBO - 6.0 POWERSTROKE - (04-07) Price: $1,249.00.  Bullet proofing a diesel motor: In addition to replacing or blocking the EGR, most 6.0L Power Stroke owners also replace the head gaskets either out of necessity or preventatively. They'll also upgrade from the factory head bolts to high-strength studs, and either clean the factory turbo vanes, which can easily become stuck, or replace the turbo with the higher performance one, such as the Garrett PowerMax. It is also important to replace the factory water pump with a much better stronger one and also upgraded fuel injection control module (FICM) can also be a benefit. Please look up bullet proofing a diesel motor on the internet, explanation is for a power Stroke motor ""bulletproofing"" is when it has at least four of the five of these actions addressed. These five areas are: Oil cooler, EGR cooler, head studs, fuel injection control module (FICM), and water pump.  THIS MOTOR IS BULLET PROOFED.   When buying a used Diesel truck it is important to know what you are buying, it is not all about how nice it looks. if there is an external engine oil cooler? Does it have the new head studs? Does it have an upgraded EGR cooler or is it block, or high performance water pump? If the answer is yes, then the engine has in fact been bulletproofed"". A Ford dealer replacement motor includes labor is $23,000 to replace a STOCK Diesel motor, which will be bullet proofed,  BUT THE STOCK PREVIOUS DIESEL MOTORS ARE NOT BULLET PROOF.  OK, a brand new 2021 F250 diesel truck off the show room floor at Lithia Ford with this bullet proof motor is $56,655 and has the California EGR valve which decrease the performances.   Find a good used F250 will have the old stock motor with lots of miles and will not include a New Garrett Turbo, AC unit, Clutch fan or any other extras that I have mention to bring this vehicle up and beyond the stock older diesels trucks. . It is a very complicated amount of work to replace a large diesel motor... The entire cab has to be lifted off the frame to remove the motor and trans. Just so it is understood all that has been done to this vehicle would have cost about $40,000 to bring it up to the new standards it now has. A very fair price of $25,000 for all that has been done to this truck and I have even reduced it to 23,900 this is very low considering in any comparison.  This is a real sweet price and deal for what this truck has been done to it..  For those that what to know who did the work, Wolf Diesel Mechanics in White City had a strong hand in this operation. I have all receipts to everything mentioned and had a two year motor warranty from , however since it has taken me over two years to complete this truck almost back to new my warranty has run aground before i even got it out on the road. Cab was removed, motor removed and new motor installed at another shop prior to the truck going over to Wolf for full completion. So, please lets not get into it over the phone. Nor do I want to get into whether I have more photos. The vehicle has been covered and I have no intention of taking more photos, come see it, hear it and ride in it, then you will not need more photos. Don't come if you are not serious, as this is a serious truck and i don't play games.",,az,42.4935,-122.8088,2021-05-04T09:32:42-0700

We have owned this car for a few years now and it has been very good to us. Garage kept and used as a weekend driver. All maintenance done on time. 3.0 liter 6 cylinder with the rare 6-speed transmission. 60K ORIGINAL MILES. Everything works great. AC blows ice cold. Top was replaced a few years back and works great. Recent oil change done 500 miles ago. DISA valve recently replaced. Upgraded sound system with 4 Polk audio component speakers, paired with an Alpine 4 channel amplifier and a matching Alpine head-unit.  Previous owner had entire steering rack replaced right before we purchased it from him. Car was involved in a front end collision and was professionally repaired, which is why it has a salvaged title. This doesn't effect the way the car drives. For its age, this car is in immaculate condition. The E46 330ci is getting extremely hard to find, especially with these miles, color and a  6-speed manual. If this car was a clean title vehicle, i would be asking $15k minimum. Car has m3 wheels (Made in Italy) paired with Michelin pilot tires, and they have plenty of life left on them. Driver side taillight needs light replaced and car needs a tailpipe welded on. Was quoted $75 at Performance muffler, but haven't had the time to take it in. I have priced the car accordingly. We are only selling, as we don't drive it. Our loss is your gain. Just paid $500 for a complete detail (pictures were taken before detail). All in all, if you're looking for an extremely low mile, reliable convertible, at a fraction of the price, this is the car for you. Title in hand and ready to sign over to its new owner. First with $8999 takes it!",,az,33.683095,-111.97197,2021-05-04T09:14:25-0700

However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Tons of power, plenty of speed, ac blows cold, cruise works, the air seat and air suspension works excellent, a great truck to drive.  We just completed the services on the transmission, differential, power steering, ac, and completed the LOF which means fresh oil, and fuel filters.  We also replaced the drive belts, wiper blades, fire extinguisher and that was about it.  We did have to fix some leaks in the air seat system, replaced some shrader valves and orfice tubes in ac system, repaired the rollup door, repaired and lubricated the liftgate, and that was about it.  These tall box trucks are very hard to find.",,az,33.415825,-111.775814,2021-05-04T08:19:38-0700

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

We only use the best name brand products as we believe corners shouldn't be cut when it comes to building your truck.-   Lifted Trucks West    Year: 2018 Make: CHEVROLET Model: SILVERADO 1500 Series: 4WD CREW CAB 143.5  LTZ W VIN: 3GCUKSEC5JG530309 Stock #: T19395 Condition: Used Mileage: 2,382  Exterior:  Interior:  Body: Passenger Transmission: Not Specified Engine: 5.3 Liter 8 Cylinder Drive Train:        COPY THIS LINK AND PASTE TO YOUR BROWSER FOR A FREE CARFAX:  http://mileage.city/uta-M33Z   Address: 7050 West Bell Road Glendale, AZ 85308 Phone: Call: 833-208-3090   Chevrolet Silverado 1500 4wd Crew Cab 143.5  Ltz W Features   Rear View Camera, Rear View Monitor In Dash, Engine Cylinder Deactivation, Memorized Settings Includes Driver Seat, Phone Voice Activated, Stability Control, Electronic Messaging Assistance With Read Function, Driver Information System, Phone Wireless Data Link Bluetooth, Roll Stability Control, Memorized Settings Includes Exterior Mirrors, Hill Descent Control, Wifi Capable, Airbags - Front - Dual, Airbags - Passenger - Occupant Sensing Deactivation, Airbags - Front - Side, Airbags - Front - Side Curtain, Air Conditioning - Front - Dual Zones, Air Conditioning - Front - Automatic Climate Control, Air Conditioning - Air Filtration, Airbags - Side-curtain Rollover Sensor, Power Brakes, Airbags - Rear - Side Curtain, Assist Handle Front, Braking Assist, Child Seat Anchors LATCH System, Reading Lights Front, Child Safety Locks, Braking assist hill start assist, ABS Brakes (4-Wheel), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution, Cruise Control, Driver Seat Heated, Body Side Moldings Chrome, Multi-function Remote Keyless Entry With Panic Alarm, Steering Wheel Mounted Controls Cruise Controls, Power Steering, Windows Tinted, Universal Garage Door Opener, Multi-function Remote Keyless Entry, Grille Color Body-Color Surround, Multi-function Remote Keyless/illuminated Entry, Remote Engine Start, Front 12V Power Outlet(s), Front 115V Power Outlet, Trip Odometer, External Temperature Display, Fuel Economy Display Range, Fuel Economy Display MPG, Headlights Auto Delay Off, Exterior Entry Lights Puddle Lamps, Warnings And Reminders Lamp Failure Low Fuel Engine Oil Coolant, Exterior Mirrors Spotter Mirror, Exterior Mirrors Power, Headlights Auto On/Off, Traction Control With Trailer Stability Assist, Security Engine Immobilizer, Daytime Running Lights LED, Seats Leather-Trimmed Upholstery, Mirror Color Chrome, Vanity Mirrors Dual Illuminating, Traction Control, Seatbelts Second Row 3-Point, Passenger Seat Heated, Rear Bumper Color Body-Color, Power Door Locks Anti-Lockout Feature, Exterior Mirrors Power Folding, Inside Rearview Mirror Auto-Dimming, Rear Seats 60-40 Split Bench, Exterior Mirrors Integrated Turn Signals, Digital Odometer, Exterior Mirrors Driver Side Auto-Dimming, Tachometer, Warnings And Reminders Maintenance Reminder, Programmable Safety Key MyKey, Headlights LED, Cargo Bed Light, Rear Seats Folds Up, Tail And Brake Lights LED, Rear Step Bumper, Security Theft-Deterrent System, Front Headrests Adjustable, Exterior Mirrors Heated, Suspension Rear Leaf Springs, Towing And Hauling Trailer Hitch, Windows Lockout Button,  Truck Sliding Rear Window Power Horizontal, Windows Rear Defogger,   Disclaimer: Lifted Trucks Westwill never sell, share, or spam your mobile number.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Bell Road Phoenix, AZ 85023			Frequently Asked Questions			 						 						 			Do I really need to call first, can I just take my chances and hope the vehicle is there?			 						 			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						About UsWe make buying and selling a pre-owned vehicle easy. Our 1Price-Pre-Owned Vehicles come with a 5-day return policy , Sirius XM and more. You can even shop online and get free home delivery . Plus, well buy your car, no purchase necessary.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Fuel system needs a new fuel pump, new lines. I will include all the fuel parts that I have acquired to date. Which includes two brand new Holley high end billet fuel filters, various AN fittings and some hose. But not all the needed parts are there. I will also include some spare parts, rear axle shafts, alternator, power steering pump, and some other parts,  I was adding a few X braces to the C pillar portion of the cage. You can remove them or finish the work with some extra tube I will also send with the rig.  The steering system needs to be put back together. I was trying to relocate the PSC brand remote reservoir. I was thinking of going to an on-pump style reservoir.   Several of the brake lines will need to be purchased and installed.  It has also been a couple of years since I started the engine and driven the rig   The rig needs tires and rims of your choice. I was using 39.5 IROKS on hummer 12 bolt double beadlocks for reference. It is currently on a set of 28 inch rollers and steel Chevy rims.   It is currently in a storage unit south of downtown Chandler. I am out of state but do have a friend there in the Phoenix area who will have an Arizona title in hand.  This rig is worth what I am asking for it considering the axles, steering, shocks, transfer case and a lower milage engine(150K).  If you are interested, please email through Craigslist and we can work out the details related to a viewing.

While driving home at night recently, the car started to misfire. Coolant was found on the top of 3 cylinders. The head gasket is fine I am told. The leak wasn't a result of overheating because it was leaking externally instead of internally. There is a known issue with these 4 cylinder engines where the head bolts strip out of the block allowing coolant to leak into the top of the cylinders. Looks like it has happened on this car. It does not drive.  Shop says it needs a heli-coil kit to fix the threads or needs a new engine block. Either way, it's too much money for me to repair. It ran well before this incident. http://www.timesert.com/html/toyota.html  Asking $1000 as is. Clean title ready to transfer.",,az,33.1911,-111.528,2021-05-03T20:58:01-0700

Look at the patina on this awesome C10. My approach was to get it running like a top, but leave the exterior alone!   To that end, the truck has less than 10k miles on a crate Vortec long block with a GMPP TBI intake. Also swapped to serpentine belt setup off of a 1994 truck. Rebuilt transmission. DJM Deluxe drop kit upper and lower arms in the front with coils and a flip kit in the rear. DJM shocks all around, she drives straight and true, no bouncing or shimmies. The MagnaFlow dual exhaust sounds amazing, and she stands on Mob Steel Del-Rays 20x8 at the front and 20x9 at the rear.  I began swapping out the interior with all new parts. The dash has been replaced as well as the new steering wheel, Dynamat installed, just waiting for someone to finish. I have new window motors, door cards, carpet, headliner, trim pieces, door pulls, lock knobs, seat belts, etc. Basically, have all the interior pieces just need to be installed. I also have a new windshield and rear window, front bumper, and tailgate.  I would love to finish and keep the truck but too many projects force a sale. She runs like a top and can be driven anywhere.",,az,33.4958,-111.9883,2021-05-03T19:32:26-0700

She's in really good condition, whether you want to go to the burger joint, dancing or on a cross country trip--she'll get you there.  These are all original miles, the car is stock with blue velour interior, no rips or tears, the windows all work, the air conditioning AC is ice cold, new tires about 500 miles ago (with warranty) and the V8 under the hood will rival just about any car on the road.  She steady maintains 15-18 mpg, uses regular unleaded but drives like she's premium and the ride down the road will remind you of sitting on your favorite sofa.    There is enough room in the trunk to transport a small elephant, add some golf clubs and probably a stroller with some additional soccer equipment.  There's also a spare tire back there.    Of course power windows, door locks, tilt, cruise, power antenna but the radio doesn't work for some reason, there's a cassette player for those retro drives around town, the body is straight, the glass is all good.  You're welcome to come and see her, talk with her and see if she might be a good fit for your family.  I am not responding to any offers until you come and see her, and I can't be lowballed because she is obviously part of my family and that would just be wrong.  So feel free to text (fastest way) and ask any questions, come take her for a friendly spin, and tell all of your friends that you've officially driven the nicest, sweetest old lady car on the planet and to plan the barbecue, cause  you're bringing her home!!!  Even if you plan to drive her cross country after you fly to Phoenix from some far off galaxy to pick her up, she'll be a breeze to drive safely home and what a surprise to your friends and family once you arrive.  I've got 100% confidence in this old gal.  Come and get her if you think you're worthy.    Oh, and she won the 1990 Car of the Year award by Motor Trend back in the day...",,az,33.610537,-112.203002,2021-05-03T19:31:49-0700

It has the AMG body trim and 19"" AMG chrome wheels. The car has never had an accident or damage and I have the clean Carfax showing regular dealer maintenance. Beautiful black exterior with black nappa leather interior and there are NO marks or tears anywhere. I bought it from the second owner in southern California.  It has a 5.5 liter V-8 with around 400 hp and a 7-speed transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Car is loaded with all factory options including auto-closing doors and keyless entry, it has night vision, push button start, distronic cruise control, active dynamic seats, heated and cooled massaging seats in the front, and rear reclining seats which are also heated and cooled! Rear window shade, high-end Harmon Kardon sound system, back-up camera, auto closing trunk and many other options. All windows have the high-end tint and UV protection. Yes, it's fully loaded and everything works.  The car now has 171,400 miles (only 12,200 miles a year) but you would never guess it. I really looks and drives like half the mileage. The engine is strong and quiet and the whole suspension was worked on a few years ago with replacement struts and pump. There are substantial receipts for maintenance work that has been done on the car. Comprehensive full maintenance since new by only Mercedes Benz dealers. The transmission shifts smoothly with no issues. There is nothing wrong with this car and EVERYTHING works! You couldn't find a nicer Mercedes S550 for the money.   I'm asking $9,4500 or best offer. Please don't waste my time with low offers as the car is well worth the price. Cash only, no trades are wanted. I am in no hurry as I am looking for the right S63. This is a private sale so there's no sales tax payable on the sale.  Please call or text me 520-497-one388 George.

Source: Edmunds  * Powerful, durable V8 engines; variety of passenger configurations; strong towing capacity. Source: Edmunds  * When it comes to moving payloads, few vehicles are as up to the task like the 2015 Chevrolet Express Cargo Vans, Passenger Vans, and Cutaways are. Chevrolet modernized its big van with rounded corners, high-mounted taillights and stylish truck-like wheels. Chevrolet designed the Express Van with the sole purpose of moving big loads, be they passengers or cargo. Dressed for passenger service, the Express Van crushes the largest of SUVs, providing seating for up to 15 people. In the Express Cargo Van, the Regular Wheelbase 1500, 2500 and 3500 models have 270.4 cubic feet of cargo space. However, if that is not enough, get the Extended Wheelbase 2500 or 3500 models, which have an incredible 313.9 cubic feet of room. It also can be outfitted as a rolling workstation. Knowing that no matter what the mission, the Express Van will need to be prepared, Chevrolet gave its van a beefed-up suspension, available extended-length cabs, a choice of gasoline or diesel engines and even optional all-wheel drive (AWD) in the 1500. All Express Cargo and Passenger Vans are equipped with stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. In the Express Cutaway 3500 and 4500 models, you will be getting a solid foundation for the finished vehicle your upfitter will complete for you. The Express Cutaway can be upfitted to become various vehicles like a school bus, shuttle bus, ambulance, service vehicle and more. It also gives you the choice between gas and diesel engines, and has anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags. Come check out the 2015 Express Van or Cutaway that meets your needs today!

Convenience features include remote keyless entry, a rearview camera, power accessories, and a driver information center.

Print this page and call us Now... We Know You Will Enjoy Your Test Drive Towards Ownership! All of our dealer added accessories are installed by our own OEM trained off road technicians. We even offer our own custom lift kits, which feature full front struts instead of spacers, upgraded rear shocks, all to create a smoother ride and better off-road performance. 99% of our competitors do not use these types of quality components because the cost is almost double that of a traditional 6-inch spacer kit. We only use the best name brand tires and wheels, as we believe knockoff brands shouldn't be used and corners shouldn't be cut when it comes to building your truck.

I‚Äôve had it since last May of 2020. My buddy had it since new and rarely drove it as he put 40,000 miles on it over the course of 7 years. I‚Äôve put 2,300 miles on it since ownership. It gets driven on average about 10 miles a week since I only have a mile commute each day. It is parked in a garage every night with a battery tender and has never been smoked in. I had it professionally detailed on 03/31/2021 by Pit Stop Auto Detailing and the engine has been cleaned, carpet was extracted/shampooed, paint was clay barred/ polished/sealed with Gtechniq Easy Coat sealant (Should last 4-6 months). Essentially looking to sell to someone that is more into it than I am now. All it really needs is a FMIC/DSG tune and it's solid. I‚Äôm a full-time student and need a truck.  The car sat for two years without being driven prior to me taking ownership of it. Once I purchased it, I did routine maintenance that was necessary. Since last May, it has been converted from Accuair to Airlift 3P. It still has height sensors on the vehicle and I have the conversion wiring harness to make them work, but have not installed it so it can be height sensing instead of pressure sensing. The Airlift was installed by a shop named RNZ Conceptz in San Diego prior to moving out to Arizona. Since moving here, all work has been done by AZ Euros. It did have the carbon cleaning, spark plugs replaced, and fuel filter changed at Desert Car Care of Chandler in June of 2020. AZ Euros has replaced the front struts with the new model of Airlift Slam Series struts and an alignment all done within the previous 6 months. The vehicle passes smog, has a tune, and looks pretty decent. It‚Äôs quick, sounds good, and is a lot of fun to drive.  Open to offers but I‚Äôm looking to get $17,000. Text works as well. I have Tuesday/Wednesdays off. Located in Chandler, AZ. This car has been babied forever. Mileage as of 03/31/2020 sits at 42,300. The mileage will go up extremely slowly, as I mentioned previously that it is driven 10 miles a week.  Hit me with offers and all your weird trades. Prefer trucks but some offers can be entertained. Message for VIN for Carfax.  Will take cash or check. Don't text me with some scam or code to follow to verify this post is real. Your number will be blocked immediately.  Moving on to specifics about the vehicle:  Air Lift Performance 3P (Has Accuair Height Sensors installed, need to calibrate for 3H) Air Lift Slam Series Front Bags  Air Lift Performance series rear  AVS Water Trap Dual Viair 444C Compressors Custom trunk setup with hardlines done by Boden Autohaus (Hardlines have since been removed. Had plans to remake them but chose to let the new owner take care of it.) TyrolSport Deadset Rigid subframe kit  Custom Catless 42 Draft Design Turbo-back Exhaust Apr Carbonio Intake Assembly  GMR CH-3 (18x9.5et35 front, 18x10et35 rear) brushed face, chrome barrel Raxles CV‚Äôs Studio RSR roll cage  OEM Golf R rear bumper  OEM Golf R sideskirts  Custom rear widebody  SRS-TEC front fenders  Shaved front bumper  Carbon front lip imported from Germany (forgive me, I forget the name and can‚Äôt find the company anywhere)  Custom diamond stitched dash mat  Suede headliner Diamond stitched sunroof cover Diamond-Stitched Junction Produce Garson Luxury Neck Pads Cobb Accessport Stratified Tune for 91/93 Octane- ‚ÄúStage 2‚Äù Tinted windshield (70%) with a film that blocks out 99% of UV rays  (Solar Gard VortexIR Ceramic Film Series) Front windows are tinted 50% Rear windows are tinted 25%  Stock parts included: Air intake assembly  Stock exhaust  2 235/40/18 Hankook Ventus v2  Battery was replaced 03/22/2020  CONS: Not huge cons by any means.  Front/rear bumper could use new clips. They‚Äôre secured by bolts but the side clips must be broken or something. Cheap fix. Rear drivers side wheel recently had something drop/fall/hit it and there‚Äôs a small chip in the chrome barrel I lost the bumper fascia driving Front lip can be repainted No tpms sensors in wheels The shop that installed the Airlift system in San Diego decided to leave the Accuair harness installed to run both compressors. I have the Airlift accessory harness to allow both compressors to be powered, I just never installed it.

I've done almost all the work on it myself and it's been excellently maintained and is in perfect running condition. The interior is in great shape as well, no pets or kids in it.  The exterior is in rough shape, the paint is fading and the clear coat is peeling off in several areas. The front and rear bumpers have scrapes and scratches and a few dings. I know the car isn't pretty but it's what's under the hood that counts and this car is ready for another 100,000 miles!  I have all the maintenance records and receipts from when I bought it, and a google doc of all maintenance and repairs with dates and mileages, which I can send for review and I'll email to the buyer.   I recently put new Yokohamas on all 4 corners, and I replaced the radiator fan assembly recently. The AC blows ice cold, everything works great on it mechanically, it's good to go. No leaks, no weird stuff.   Come to Gilbert to see the car, I can meet you at the Burger King on the corner of Juniper and Gilbert.
