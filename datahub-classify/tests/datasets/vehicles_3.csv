It's an extremely competitive class of vehicle, but Honda has successfully been building excellent subcompacts longer than just about any other manufacturer in the United States. The big selling point for the 2016 Fit is how much space it crams into a relatively small footprint. It offers nearly five more cubic feet of interior volume than in the previous generation Fit. However, the 2016 Fit is actually shorter in length than it was in 2015.Interesting features of this model are compact exterior, economical price, Honda reliability, great fuel economy, high levels of standard equipment, and Roomy interior    Kendall Ford Lincoln of Anchorage☎ 877-919-59411950 GambellAnchorage, AK 99501   Call us today at 877-919-5941Or use the link below to view more information!

I ran and got them a one-way permit to drive it back to Fairbanks and the lady forgot to give me my title and doesn't open until Monday so they had to get back to base. I'm not going to go lower than what we agreed on with them. It is a great running car they were super happy to get it but then couldn't because the title wasn't available until tomorrow which is monday.   The reason they were able to talk me down to 8,000. When we replace the catalytic converter we only had time to weld up the exhaust with the new catalytic converter and we didn't have time to punch in the new O2 sensor. Into the exhaust. For some reason the previous owner took off the sun visors. They also took off the rumble pack/ Muffler. I think they like the louder sound of it or something. It does have one crack across the windshield which is completely out of your view. For some reason the traction control says it's not working or the cruise control. I would get a new middle console lid as it's it's a little wrinkly. The back hinges for the hatch dont hold it up anymore. And the previous owner reported hitting a curb so that's why the damage to the front bumper cover. As shown in the pictures.  Just simple small things.

With its 2016 Silverado 1500, Chevrolet has staked its claim once again as king of the hill. The 2016 Silverado boasts a refined level of comfort, sophistication and brute force not found in trucks from Ford and Ram, specifically in the all-aluminum range of engines, where Chevy has laid claim to the most fuel-efficient V8 found in a full-size truck. In fact, at 23 mpg on the highway, the 5.3L unit provides a better return than the turbocharged V6 employed in the Ford F-150. Add in the fact that Chevy managed to make so many innovative changes while keeping the base price steady, and it's no surprise that the Silverado is a hit.This model sets itself apart with extensive features and options, best fuel economy of any V8 pickup, best-in-class tow ratings, and Improved interior with added comfort and convenience    Kendall Ford Lincoln of Anchorage☎ 877-919-59411950 GambellAnchorage, AK 99501   Call us today at 877-919-5941Or use the link below to view more information!

The truck had 27700 miles on it when i bought it (highway driver, no hauling) and i put the 5th Wheel hitch on it and bought the 2019 Winnebago NEW last summer from the same dealer at the same time. Everything about the 5th Wheel (from hitch to rear bumper) is in like-new shape (some stickers still on the appliances). I have only towed the trailer about 8000 - 9000 miles and it has virtually no wear/tear. I was stored from November until May. I pulled the trailer from Washington to Colorado to Texas and back to Washington three times for work, the rest of the mileage is long highway commutes. My job changed and i don't need it anymore.   Truck: 2019 F350 Super Duty Lariat Package (fully loaded) New Tires at ~40,000 miles, and they are in great shape, as i've towed very little and only drive on the freeway.  I had Ford add the F350 front end stabilizer upgrade, although the trailer pulls straight (belt & suspenders) Long list of options included, fully decked out I take care of my equipment and you'll find nothing but road dust on this beauty.   5th Wheel Hitch: Reese 20K Adjustable Track for tight manuvering  Trailer: 2019 Winnebago Minnie Plus 5th Wheel Model# 29RBH 2019C VIN# 54CFM4Y2XK4024684 Bought NEW 6/27/2020 (same time as i bought the truck) Exterior: Platinum Interior: Pearl Theater Seating Extreme Weather Package RVIA Tag Wide Screen TV Electric Fireplace/Heater Bunk House Two Slide Outs Two Doors Bathroom for Privacy Queen Bed Three Bunks and Storage in Bunk House Lots of Storage Everywhere Leveling Blocks Electric rear stabilizers Back Up Camera Out Door Shower Out Door Fridge and Stove Top LPG Connection for BBQ LPG & Electric Heat Two Air Conditioners LED lighting Full Electric Awning (never used) I proactively replaced the tires at 5000 miles. They are top quality E rated tires. All Cords/plugs/etc are of the highest quality (over $2000 of stuff)  See video here (not my trailer, just off of YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jkoE0_JZI  Full Details on the Trailer Model: https://www.rvusa.com/rv-guide/2019-winnebago-minnie-plus-fifth-wheel-floorplan-29rbh-tr39785   Please inquire only if you have decided that is set up is what you want. I am crazy busy and really just want to work with someone if they love the rig.   I don't need the trailer and the truck is a BEAST of a machine. Best 1-Ton Puller on the road, as can be attested to by all the guys at the fuel stops who i talked to. The F350 Super Duty tows the trailer like magic and i was never under powered or under-braked.   Generator: https://www.cummins.com/generators/onan-p4500i-inverter-portable-generator  I have a hella good Cummings generator that i will negotiate on but they are sold out and very hard to find, for good reason. Bought it at Power Generation Service in Albuquerque, still under warranty. It is NOT for sale with the rig, but would consider adding it into the package if its really important to the buyer.   The rig is currently in Bellingham WA. I will deliver to Anchorage on the Ferry or you can pick up.

It’s been in my family since 2011. It still drives great and gets around awesome in the winter. Has blizzak all season tires on it that probably have a season left. I have most of the maintenance records since 2011. Mostly serviced at Specialized Auto Imports. Would be a great first car for someone.   Full disclosure:   Front right tire rod is corroded & will need to be fixed before next tire rotation. It was quoted to me at about $300.   Check engine light is almost always on. Gives codes for catalytic converter & knock sensor. My mechanic said he doesn’t think it’s worth fixing as it’s just an emissions issue.   Back driver side door doesn’t lock with the fob or the driver side lock button, so you have to manually lock and unlock it.   I think the parking break is no longer working, but I haven’t gotten it looked at.   BUT it has a table that acts as the bottom trunk of the car that can be popped out for car camping.

Cold weather package, includes heated seats and steering wheel.  Excellent condition, second owner.  Owned since 2015.  Bought from original owner when car was one year old, she had bought the car new from BMW of Anchorage, original MSRP of $37,020.  Original dealer sticker is included in the pictures to answer questions about equipment and options.  Car is current on all maintenance and needs nothing.  Tires, brakes both front and back are all nearly new.    The vehicle size is comparable to a Subaru Crosstrek, but much more enjoyable to drive and you don’t have to replace head gaskets.   I also have a complete winter tire/factory wheel set I'll include for an extra $1000 with almost new Pirelli Winter Sottozero tires (no, I will not sell this set separate from the car).   Acceptable form of payment is cashiers check or financing from local bank, not interested in trades or low ball dealer offers.

All wheel drive. Power windows and locks. Spare tire and jack included. Set of summer tires and winter tires (practically new Nokian Hakkapeliitta R3 studless winter tires). Two keys. Has engine block heater (also new) and a tow hitch. Has permanent registration. No dents or dings. Carfax for previous owner available (12 years worth). Clean title. Comes with the owners manual. No chips or cracks in the windshield.  This is a truly great car. When we bought it from the first owner, we thought we'd have it for decades so we took care of it as if we'd have it forever. We're selling it because we need something bigger for our business. It's never given us any trouble, we're always on time with oil changes and maintenance. It'll need an oil change in about 1,000 more miles.   It's got a ton of space in the hatch back, the extra set of tires are back there now. When we got the hitch installed the guy commented that the under carriage is in great shape, and ""it clearly has never been to the beach"" because there was no rust.   The seats could use a shampooing since they're cloth, and the tire pressure monitoring light comes on a couple times a year (we bring it straight into the tire shop when it happens and they have never found anything wrong with it, they said it's probably due to weather fluctuations).   It's a great car. We trust it for long road trips, camping trips, or just errands. If you're interested contact me for a test drive.

I have always stored it inside my heated garage with a car cover on it, and the previous owner did the same.  It has 1.9 liter inline 4 cylinder and a 4 speed syncro-mesh manual gearbox and  disc brakes up front and rack and pinion steering.  This car was built in West Germany by the Opel company.  General Motors contracted Opel to build them and they were sold at a Pontiac dealership.  They are often referred to as the ""mini corvette"", even though they were designed first.  It has the pop up headlights that rotate instead of hinge vertically. The interior is in great shape too.  All dials and gauges work properly and the upholstery has no tears or rips in it.  The drivers side floor mat does have a worn spot from the drivers heel.   It has lap and shoulder belts that were added when they were received in the US.  So the buckles have the GM badge on them. It has a ""parcel shelf"" behind the front seats where you can put groceries or golf clubs.  It is a fastback, so there is no trunk.  The spare tire is behind a flap below the rear window.   The previous owner had some work done on the head and installed a slightly better exhaust header while he was at it. It is a great cruising car that is actually comfortable and a joy to drive.  It by no means is ""fast"" or ""quick"", despite its looks.  So if your looking for something that will do burnouts, this is not it.  I purchased this car about 8 years ago for my son and I to drive.  He learned to drive a ""stick shift"" at the age of 12 and was able to take it to his prom.  He has recently left the house and so I wont be using it as much, which is why I am selling it.  It does have one spot of rust on the drivers side that was there when I got it.  I have included a photo of that spot.  I have made sure to dry the car real good every time I washed it.    Since I have owned it I have had the following done by and older mechanic; Changed the oil and filter  New front and rear shocks Alignment A few gaskets, seals and bearings  Its all original except for the following upgrades: Wheels Carb and K@N air filter (carb is a weber and I have the original Solex) Electronic ignition Fuel Pump Fuel/Water separator New battery last year Exhaust header  It will come with: Owners manual Two service manuals, (one has the disc with manual on it), these are complete shop manuals Owners workshop manual Opel parts catalogue Opel GT source parts catalogue Original Solex carb Bag of Misc. goodies  Thanks for looking I don't need help selling, Cash only, and not interested in any trades including guns or other cars  Peter  AK area code-830-1668 Text and calls ok",,ak,61.16167,-149.86312,2021-04-29T12:18:34-0800

The person I bought it from had done a slip yoke eliminator on the t-case and had installed a ""newer"" 4.0 six cylinder engine with approximately 100k miles and a new clutch while they were in there. The body has 268k miles. It drives great starts right up and is quiet. As far as I can tell everything works well, including the air, heater and radio/cruise.  What does it need? An alignment, a headlight and you may choose to replace the windshield. I have a printout of the features this rig came with and it has the dana 44 reared with disc brakes and a trac loc. I think it is built well, not stupid big, but big enough make bad decisions tomorrow if that's your thing. We are downsizing on all the toys in order to build a house. That being said I am firm on the price as I would rather use it on the weekends then take a bath on it. I know it's not priced right for everyone and I can live with that.

Vehicle comes with 4 winter tires (used only one season), front seat covers and a matching paint kit for chips - a MUST in Alaska!   Recently detailed with an oil change and all fluids topped off. Besides normal wear and tear, the vehicle’s only known issue is the passenger side mirror has some light damage to it (see photos). However, both powered mirror adjusters work perfectly.

Reviews: * If you want a new SUV that seats up to seven but you don’t want to spend a lot of money, the Dodge Journey could be for you. If you can swing a few thousand more for a higher trim, a V6 Journey with Chrysler’s Uconnect infotainment system is especially appealing. Source: KBB.com * Seating for up to seven available built-in booster seats useful interior storage solutions smart touchscreen interface. Source: Edmunds * Though perfectly suited for the city, the Dodge Journey is always ready when you need a little quality time off the grid. Wherever you take it, the Journey brings comfort along for the ride for up to seven people. A 173hp, 2.4L, 4-Cylinder Dual VVT Engine powers the American Value Package, SE, SXT, and Crossroad models, in conjunction with a 4-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA estimated 26 MPG on the highway, plus it can get over 500 highway miles per tank. The mid-range SXT gives you the choice between the 2.4L or an incredible 283hp Pentastar V6 Engine to get your heart racing. The V6 is the standard engine in the Limited and R/T. The SE, SXT, Limited, and R/T can also be purchased with optional All-Wheel Drive. Further, all models come with AutoStick that gives you clutchless manual shifting for more exciting drives. Standard equipment for the Journey includes items like a 4.3-inch touch-screen AM/FM radio with CD player, a USB port and audio input jack, push-button start, in-floor storage in the 2nd row, a covered storage bin in the rear cargo area, and 17-inch wheels. Dependent on the trim you select, option possibilities include: 3-zone automatic air conditioning, 19-inch wheels, leather seating, 3rd-row seats, Flip ‘n Stow compartment, UConnect Hands-free Communication network, navigation, six premium speakers with subwoofer and a 368-watt amplifier, a rearview camera, and ParkSense parking assist.

Original truck manual included.  Some extra parts come with the vehicle.  Bed of truck is water tight and although there is rust on the truck, most of the body is in reasonably good shape.    53,700 miles on the odometer. Have title.   This was my fathers vehicle.  He purchased it at least 17 years ago as a project that he never got to.  I have not been able to verify this, but I have been told this was a fire truck in a rural community here in Alaska for many years.  I am also told that the white numbered markings on the back wall of the engine compartment signify it was probably a government vehicle at some point (making the prior claim more likely).  There also appears to be holes on top of the front fenders which could have been for extra lights.  Text or Email only please.

I am selling TWO ford ranger 4wd trucks AS A SET FOR ONE PRICE. Sorry, I will not part out.  The Deal also comes with a color matched bed topper and a bed extender that fits these rigs.  Both trucks have 4.0L motors & same drivetrain parts. Engines purr and heater works good.  Parts are interchangeable between both of them. All the spares you could need.  Both are automatics and 4WD models.  Both are the supercab version with 4 doors.  Both have average interiors and the typical ford seat rub issue. They are not perfect on the inside, but dont have smells either.  Both have alaska windshields.  Both have decent tires.  Both run and drive, but each has its own issues.  One is tagged, the other is not.  One has a title, the other does not.  One is a 2000 model, the other is a 2001 model.  One has running boards, the other does not.  One has 230,000 miles, the other has 161,000 miles.  One has privacy glass on the door windows, the other does not.  The Other stuff:  The overdrive indicator light is flashing on the 2001. Dont have a code reader that will read it..could be a simple fix.  The 2000 will either need the 4wd selector switch fixed or the 4wd looked at.  The 2000 has new rotors, brakes, and brake calipers.  The tailgate latch just broke on the 2000..just releases one side, so you will need a screwdriver to unlatch the other side or leave it unlatched.   Use one for all the spare parts you will ever need or fix both and have 2 rigs to drive.  I have owned these trucks for a few years. I used the tagged one during summers to haul parts/materials back from lowes and whatnot. I bought the other at an auto auction as a spare parts rig for the tagged one, changed my mind, and then fixed it up. It had minor damage to the front passenger corner, so it doesnt take much for an insurance company to total out these older rigs. Their loss, my gain at the time.   Pic shows plastic fender missing on the 2001, but it is inside the cab.  The lower valence for the 2000 is in the truck bed and included. I took it off as I was going to put a small plow on the truck and then changed my mind.  Im selling because I have too many vehicles.  I have other vehicles i am selling at various prices with other issues I have kept for  various reasons over the years. I now have 9 vehicles and all but one runs and drives. Simply dont have the time or inclinqtion to do all the little things to sell them for more. My loss your gain.  $3500 FIRM. I have an F150 i need to fix, and gotta pay bills.   More pics available upon request.   I also have for sale:  2005 toyota camry xle, 273,000 miles. Needs front shocks and an alternator eventually. Runs good. Needs airbag light reset after getting tapped a few years ago on the back drivers side. No tags/plates. Alaska windshield. Will come with a new battery. Also comes with 2 unmounted spare tires and an extra set of 4 rims. Owned her since new. Asking $2500  2007 ford focus. Needs new brake pads. Busted windshield. Drivers outside doorhandle needs replaced (part on hand). Body is rough is some places, but runs good. Will need a bearing on the cv axle on the passenger side replaced eventually. Interior needs a cleaning but no smells. Tires are decent and will get you where you need to go. Have title and is Z tagged. 217,000 miles. 2wd automatic. Asking $700  1978 Dodge jamboree RV motorhome. Runs and drives but been sitting for about 2 years. Tires are good and hold air.  Needs TLC in the cabover area and bathroom. Needs cleaning.

Missing rear seats, otherwise body and interior are ok. Rolls. Bought at auto auction to convert to a special purpose vehicle, changed my mind. Will not part out, must take whole vehicle.
